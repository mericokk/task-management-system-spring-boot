## Features
- 3-Tier Architecture: The application is structured with presentation, service, and data access layers.
- ORM Support: Utilizes Spring Data JPA and Hibernate for data persistence and object-relational mapping.
- RESTful APIs: Provides API endpoints with JSON data interchange for seamless client-server communication.
- PostgreSQL Database: Integrated PostgreSQL for data storage and retrieval optimization.
- Custom Error Handling: Implements custom exceptions to enhance application resilience and provide user-friendly error reporting.
